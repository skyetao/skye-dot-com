title: "But is Dylan as radical as we want him to be?"
---

A few disaggregated thoughts on Dylan's relationship to the Civil Rights Movement and questions about how we perceive and discuss Dylan's role as the voice of a protest movement or radical artist. 

#### On "Hurricane" 

I've always been struck by Dylan's use of the N-word on this track, a song that is ostensibly about a black man's wrongful incarceration and the injustice of the prison system in America. Contextually, Dylan deploys it in a stanza where he is talking about the black community's perception of Rubin Carter. Why does Dylan as a white performer take up that word in this context? What does it do for the "social messaging" of the song? 

#### On the Christian Period 

When thinking about Dylan's relationship to the Civil Rights Movement, how do we fully attend to his Christian period and the conservative rhetoric he puts forward during that time? In "Allowed to Be Free," Hughes argues that "Dylan's most important later contributions to the musical and ideological mix that he brought to his movement songs are found in his Christian period," highlighting that Dylan's formal deployment of gospel allowed him to more authentically explore "the dual themes of redemption and reckoning" (55). Hughes goes on to write about "Pressing On" as part of a lineage of "freedom songs." But how do we attend to the more inflamatory moments of this period? In the song "Slow Train," for example, the stanza about Middle Eastern oil interests in America do not feel like a furthering of Dylan's work with the Civil Rights Movement, but rather conservative language one might expect to hear on Fox New: "All that foreign oil controlling American soil / Look around you, it’s just bound to make you embarrassed / Sheiks walkin’ around like kings / Wearing fancy jewels and nose rings / Deciding America’s future from Amsterdam and to Paris."

#### On Irony

For me, one of the most defining characteristics of Dylan is his prickly-ness as an artist. He has built a persona based off of being contrarian. He is rude to the press (or refuses to talk to them for decades at a time). He falsifies information, whether that be his name and origins, or more recently, falsifying information in the Scorcese Netflix documentary about the Rolling Thunder Revue. Many attribute this prickly transition most strongly with his electric period and after, but I think this has deep roots in his persona and music from the very beginning. A song like "With God On Our Side," for example, reeks of teenage anger and irony to me. When thinking about an artist for whom nothing is necessarily real, how do we fully attend to a personfication of radicalism? Is it there, or do we want it to be there?

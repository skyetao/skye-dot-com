title: Silence in *Corregidora*
---

There's much to digest about the music of Gayl Jones' 1975 novel *Corregidora* and the way Jones seamlessly entwines Ursa's experience as a blues singer into the fabric of the novel right down to its form. Jones' text is formally rich and textured. The language is stripped bare: Jones uses only the words that are absolutely necessary, layering and repeating words and phrases throughout the novel to develop the world in song. Most of the novel is dialogue, either in real time or memory (or sometimes both simultaneously) and there is very little narration. Jones never really *describes* anything. As readers our experience of Ursa's singing comes second-hand—we are told what singing signifies for Ursa, the cathartic power it brings her, and what it means for her lovers and how they hear her voice and changes within it throughout the novel—yet her song is the lens through which we hear her story.  

So what does Ursa Corregidora *sound* like? 

In the absence of being able to hear Ursa ourselves, who do we hear instead? We hear Ma' Rainey, Ella Fitzgerald, Bessie Smith, and, of course, Billie Holiday. Jones scatters references to these iconic singers throughout the novel, grounding us temporally and aesthetically, and leaving us to connect the dots. With the absence of first-hand descriptors, using these iconic voices as archetypes is an easy avenue for a reader of *Corregidora* to hear the world of the novel. We can never really know what Ursa sounds like, so we turn to the nearest approximations we have. 

In her monograph *Race of Sound*, Nina Sun Eidsheim writes about the "acousmatic question," or the desire to identify voice, pinpointing it to a specific person. Eidsheim argues that asking "who is speaking?" assumes that the voice is fixed, that the question has a right or wrong answer, and thus leads to a desired truthmaking that creates and perpetuates racialized vocal assumptions. In the case of Billie Holiday, Eidsheim argues that the reliance on listening to Holiday through the lens of her biography—the archetype that has been created of the black blueswoman who has lived a hard life—strips her of her agency and reduces her to the persona of Billie Holiday rather than an artist. How does Eidsheim's critique interrogate our aural interpretation of Ursa's voice? How might we listen to her differently?  

As intriguing as *Corregidora*'s music is its silences. "I said nothing," refrains through the text like Ursa's mantra, punctuating her mundane interactions and disrupting moments of pain. The phrase becomes a stand in for everything from "there's simply nothing more to say," to "there's more but I won't tell you." In *Black Resonance*, Emily Lordi writes of the reciprocal relationship between black music and literature, and uses *Corregidora* as a framework of disruption for listening to Billie Holiday's late recordings that reifies Holiday's artistic agency. Lordi points to Jones' use of formal texture and repetition as "troubling the narrative of the blueswoman's transparent singing voice" (150). In a similar way, I'm interested in how we might read silence in *Corregidora* as deliberate acts of disruption. 

Moments of silent disruption are not Ursa's alone, rather, Jones weaves it into the generational narrative of the Corregidora legacy. Ursa visits her mother to finally ask her about her father. In relating the story of Martin, Ma speaks of the last time she saw him and his brutal beating of her: “I started to scream. And then I said, Naw, to myself. I said, Naw, I wasn’t going to scream for no nigger, and having people coming up there and make me feel worse than I did already. I said, Naw, I wasn’t going to scream for no nigger.” Here Jones provides us with a deliberate agency to silence. It is a choice Ma makes. One which disrupts social expectations. One of pride. Within the generational framework Jones establishes between Gram, Ma, and Ursa, we can understand this choice as one that has been passed down through the line. Ursa's silence is deliberate act of withholding, one which reifies the agency of her song: she has the power to silence or sing what she needs to. 

**Further Questions:** How might we carry this notion of silent disruption back into the music to understand the musical pause in a different way? How might we place Ma's suppressed scream in conversation with Nel's suppressed scream in Toni Morrison's *Sula* or Aunt Hester's infamous scream to further a definition of sonic disruption through the black female voice?

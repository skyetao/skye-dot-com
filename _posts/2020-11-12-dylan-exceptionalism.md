title: 'On "Dylan Exceptionalism"'
---

The Gospel Period. The Christian Trilogy. Born-Again Bob. There are a myriad of ways to refer to Dylan's 1979-1981 songmaking period, all of which apply, and none of which quite hit the mark. Like other pivotal points in Dylan's artistic career, this period—if it can even be confined to one discreet set of time or albums—defies concrete definition. 

In *Rednecks, Queers, and Country Music*, Nadine Hubbs offers a restorative reading of modern popular country music by unpacking decades of bias layered onto the working-class subjecthood often addressed in country music. Hubbs locates the start of this bias in the 1970s with the conservative turn in American culture, identifying middle-class whites as the main perpetrators of this cultural class violence in an effort to firm up middle-class status. The trope of the backwards redneck became intrinsically tied with popular country music, even though there is no cultural historical backing for such a connection. Hubbs draws a parallel between the cultural malignment of country music by the middle-class and that rap, "country, like rap, is marked by race and class and associated with particular, rather than neutral or universal, subjectiveness" (55). She identifies that what sets rap apart is the cultural capital offered to the white middle class by listening to rap as a cross-racial inclusivity, but that country music can offer no such cultural capital. 

Extending Hubbs' framework for understanding the role of white middle-class bias in cultural tastemaking to a reading of Dylan's Christian period allows us to interrogate the gut reaction many have felt to write off this period from Dylan's oeuvre. We can begin to read this period as an extension of Dylan's artistic concerns with working class Americana meeting the sonic needs of the moment. It is in some ways, then, Dylan just being Dylan. 

Parallel to Hubbs' writings on country music and conservatism, in *The Devil's Music*, Randall Stephens writes about the rise of Christian rock as codified in the 1970s and the relationship with the conservative turn in American politics. Stephens highlights the longstanding influence of Pentecostalism on the development of early rock and roll, and the way this influence worked across racial lines throughout rock's early history. Stephens argues that rock has always been steeped in the modality of Christian music, and traces the history of tension between Christian leaders and rock musicians in the 1950s and '60s as rock supplanted Christian values on the national cultural stage, through acceptance and reappropriating of rock and roll into the Christian fold in the 1970s. 

As with Hubbs, from Stephens' cultural history we can understand Dylan's Christian period as responding to the cultural moment—a shift that is less unnatural than modern listeners of Dylan might perceive. What Stephens begins to showcase of the relationship between Pentecostalism and the reciprocal interracial influence of this religious sect on early rock and roll allows an avenue towards reading Dylan's relationship to Gospel music and black female artistry during his Christian period. In some ways, we are offered an avenue for a restorative reading in which Dylan is returning rock and roll to its core values and sonic purity. But such a reading really only works if you believe that early rock artists like Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis were influenced by black music and not stealing it. 

And here we return to the tricky question: in scholars like Hubbs and Stephens we can unpack Dylan's Christian period within a cultural historical moment, giving us a space to engage with the music not purely from a reactionary perspective, but to make allowances for it within the cultural narrative of America and the narrative of Dylan—but what might this mean for us to understand Dylan, the voice of the '60s, within such a network? 

I would argue there are two main takeaways we should be grappling with: 

1) In the context of the artistic persona of Dylan, I think that this combats the notion of "Dylan exceptionalism." There is a desire to place Dylan as a figure outside of the bounds of his contemporaries, to not interrogate prickly artistic choices, like his use of the N-word in "Hurricane" for example, where we might another artist, because Dylan belongs outside the realm of his cultural moment. The Christian period shows us that this is not true. That we can, and in fact should, be reading Dylan in relationship to his cultural moment, the influence this has had on his work, and in turn the influence he has wielded on the cultural moment. In the case of his Christian period, that means grappling with Dylan imbrication with and contributions to Reagan's America. 
   
2) In the context of our cultural understanding of the long 1960s, I argue the ease with which we can draw a through-line from the "radical" '60s to Reagan's America via a figure such as Dylan also combats a notion of "'60s exceptionalism," insofar as it relates to the white cultural memory at least.

I am typing a paragraph! If I want a new paragraph, I do this. 

## Header 1

On a new line, a new paragraph. 

If I want something in *italics*, I put asterisks around it. If I want something in **bold**, I put more asterisks around it. 

If I want to [link](http://theodorejotter.com) to something, I do that. 

### Header 2

If I want to put an image in here, I ask Jeffrey.

(The syntax is like this ![/link/], it's complicated, just have Jeffrey do it.)I am typing a paragraph!

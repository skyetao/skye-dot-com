title: "Rhythm and Disruption"
---

The world of Tim Maughan's *Infinite Detail* is punctuated with the rhythmic heartbeat of jungle music. It is the sonic embodiment of the community within this apocalyptic internet-less vision of Bristol, tying together survivors with a shared nostalgia, nursing their wounds, and soundtracking their uprisings. In this world, music is most urgently that which shatters the silence (6). It is insurgent. It is disruptive, on a basal level, to the quotidian pursuit of survival. 

In their essay "808s & Heartbreak," Katherine McKittrick and Alexander G. Weheliye outline the notion of heartbreak within black life using the 808 drum machine as an example of embodied technology which highlights the interplay between empowerment and (sexual) violence in the black experience. For McKittrick and Weheliye, music represents the literal heartbeat of the black community. Music is essential to breaking and mending in everyday life under systemic anti-black racism. McKittrick and Weheliye are not interested in promotion of musical exceptionalism. Like Kyle Devine, they point to ways that music is as tied to the very violence it also brushes against, in their case sexual violence as opposed to Devine's ecological or petrocapitalistic violence. 

I'm interested in the way *Infinite Detail* and "808s & Heartbreak" both establish a dual agenda to music's cultural power: it disrupts and mends, shatters and repairs, soundtracks a heartbeat and heartbreak. There is a way in which these two sides must always coexist within this framework, that music can never disrupt one thing without perhaps bringing together something else or vice versa. 

### Questions I Thought of But Couldn't Answer This Week:
1. If we were going to make a playlist of "disruptive" songs, what would be on it? Is it possible to even make such a list? Does it change on the time, place, cultural moment in question? 
2. Can anything be sonically disruptive if deployed under the right circumstances, or is there a deeper defining characteristic we can pinpoint?
3. How does this notion of disruption tie in with the performer/performance itself? I'm thinking of the character of Melody in *Infinite Detail* who stages a hostile musical takeover of a mall. Her music is literally disrupting. Her persona is being used as a symbol by the radical online groups who seek to puppet her as a face for their internet revolution, yet she also defies them, living when she should have died, becoming a double symbol for black female agency.

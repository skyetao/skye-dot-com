I'm a writer and lover of vinyl and old stereos. I'm currently pursuing my masters in English at George Washington University. My research interests include: countercultural development, radicalism, popular music studies, sonic disruption, African American literature, Bob Dylan. 

Every Halloween I pay homage to David Bowie with a decorated pumpkin.
